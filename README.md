#Salmonid-Population-Trends-in-Washington-State
Salmonids are a family of fish that include salmon, trout, and char. These species are native to Washington State and are vital both ecologically and culturallyâ€”especially to Indigenous tribes, commercial fisheries, and local ecosystems.

Over the past few decades, salmonid populations in Washington have shown significant declines due to several factors, such as:

Habitat loss from urban development and logging

Climate change, leading to warmer waters and altered river flows

Pollution from agricultural and industrial sources

Overfishing

Barriers to migration, like dams and culverts, that prevent salmon from reaching spawning grounds

Efforts to monitor and reverse these trends involve:

Restoration of river habitats

Removal or modification of barriers

Hatchery programs

Enforcing fishing regulations

Collaborative conservation efforts with tribal governments

Understanding these trends helps guide policies to protect these keystone species and restore balance to Washington's aquatic ecosystems.
